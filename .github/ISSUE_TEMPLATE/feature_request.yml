        This issue form is for requesting features. Please note that we are
        not affiliated to Plugwise nor Nabu Casa and just humble developers
        supporting Plugwise hardware to work with Home Assistant.

        In reviewing your feature request, we might be unable or less willing
        to implement in `plugwise_usb-beta` and even more so prepare for Core-
        integration if your request is not in line with the [Development site][ds]
        information and/or [HA ADRs][adr].

        If you have a problem, please use the appropriate [issue template][it].

      label: How did you install plugwise_usb-beta?
      description: >
        You could be using the core-integration and just asked to leave feedback/improvements here, but more likely you installed either through HACS or manually as a `custom_component`.
        Feel free to select Core even if you are actually **not** using plugwise_usb-beta, no problem, we gladly look into it to see if we can upstream it to Core eventually!

      options:
        - HACS
        - Manually installed `custom_component`
        - Cloned from GitHub
        - Home Assistant Core
